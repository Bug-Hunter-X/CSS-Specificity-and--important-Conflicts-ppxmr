The solution involves properly understanding CSS specificity and avoiding `!important` where possible:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}
.other p {
  color: red;
}
```

Here, the paragraph within the div will be blue. We use a class `.other` for the other paragraphs. This approach is more maintainable and readable than using `!important`.
