# CSS Specificity and !important Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue related to specificity and the overuse of `!important`.  The `bug.css` file contains CSS code that exhibits unexpected behavior due to incorrect understanding and application of CSS specificity and the unnecessary use of !important. The `bugSolution.css` shows a corrected version.

## Problem

CSS specificity can be confusing, especially when dealing with nested selectors and the `!important` declaration.  Overuse of `!important` makes maintenance difficult and can break the normal cascading order of styles.

## Solution

The solution involves a careful understanding of CSS specificity and avoiding the use of `!important` whenever possible.  By structuring CSS selectors and using more specific selectors, we avoid the need to use the `!important` flag, creating a more maintainable and predictable styling system.
